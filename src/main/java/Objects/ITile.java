/**
 * General explanation:
 * Every non-player component in our game is supposed to be in type of specific tile.
 * Therefore, to be able to place different objects on the same tile, we have chosen to represent
 * the board in 4 different layers --> grids.
 *
 * Some objects will be placed on tiles in the background layer, some in the foreground layer and some in the
 * middleground layer.
